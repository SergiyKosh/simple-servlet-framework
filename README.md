# Simple servlet framework
This project is being developed by me for improve my knowledge in Reflection and learn how Spring Framework working inside.
## Tech stack
- Java 11
- Jakarta Servlet as Core
- Apache Tomcat as Servlet container
- Reflections for class search
- Lombok to avoid boilerplate code
## Now implemented
1. Dispatcher servlet that handles all http-requests and directs them to controllers;
2. Servlet filter to avoid blocking requests by CORS policy;
3. @Controller and @RestController annotations. Difference between them in the data mapping. @Controller mapps data as jsp page, @RestController - as JSON;
4. @GetMapping, @PutMapping, @PostMapping, @DeleteMapping and @OptionsMapping annotations for handling http-requests.
## Projects which will be written using this framework
Link to a project that will be demonstrate framework features will be here :)
